# Coding Task

## How to replicate my report

You can recreate the findings presented in my full_report.pdf by following these simple steps:

1. Run the Report.Rmd file.

2. Then, run the A1.Rmd file.

3. Attach the A2.doc file

For simulating survey data separately, you can use the data_sim.R file. This file is already integrated into the A1.Rmd file to produce the graphics and tables featured in the full_report.
