# Coding Task

## How to replicate my report?

You can recreate the findings presented in my full_report.pdf by following these simple steps:

1. Run the *Report.Rmd* in the code file

2. Then, run the *A1.Rmd*  in the appendix file

3. Attach the A2.doc in the appendix file

For simulating survey data separately, you can use the data_sim.R file. This file is already integrated into the A1.Rmd file to produce the graphics and tables featured in the full_report.
